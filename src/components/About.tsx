        I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating user-friendly experiences. I've been working remotely for the past five years, focusing primarily on web development and backend development. I'm currently based in New York City.
        I enjoy collaborating with teams to design and develop innovative solutions. I'm also always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer, cooking, and exploring the city. I find solace in the simple pleasures of life and the connections I build through my work.
        I'm always open to discussing opportunities to work together, so don't hesitate to reach out.
        Thank you for taking the time to read about me!
